This archive contains a collection of film simulation profiles in the Hald Color Look-Up Table pattern (Hald CLUT). Unless otherwise noted in the filename, they are all in the sRGB color space, 8-bit per channel, in the PNG image format. Most of them are designed to mimic the results of various film stocks, pushed and pulled in various ways or faded over time.

Use the level 12 pattern Hald_CLUT_Identity_12.tif to create your own profiles, see the RawPedia article to find out how.
